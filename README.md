## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use, in a small project, my previous Css knowledge. There are many things that I still do not know, so I will continue studying and improving my code skills.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) 
  His CSS tutorials and Videos helped me to improve my CSS skills. I am going to continue watching his Youtube Channel.

- [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbwXnUipZsLfUckBPsC7Jog)
  Inspiration for future projects.

If you want more help with writing markdown, I'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
